## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE: Number Range Validation

**ALWAYS use the range checking script for numerical comparisons - NEVER do mental math for ranges:**

When you need to check if any number falls within a range:
1. **STOP** - Do not attempt to compare numbers mentally
2. **USE THE SCRIPT**: `python3 scripts/check_range.py [value] [min] [max] [value] [min] [max] ...`
3. **EXAMPLE**: `python3 scripts/check_range.py 185 125 200 92 70 100`
4. **TRUST THE RESULT**: Use the script output, not your own calculation

**Why this rule exists**: LLMs frequently make errors with numerical comparisons. The script provides 100% accurate mathematical results.

**Common use cases**:
- Health metrics (cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure)
- Budget categories (spending within planned ranges)
- Financial targets (investment performance ranges)
- Any situation requiring "is X between Y and Z?"

## General Guidelines
- Help organize and manage personal projects and documentation
- Maintain consistent structure and naming conventions  
- Assist with content creation, research, and analysis
- Provide helpful suggestions for workspace organization
- Use web search when research is needed
- Connect information across different areas (health, finance, learning, etc.)

## File Management
- Use clear, descriptive file and folder names
- Maintain logical organization structure
- Keep related materials grouped together
- Regular cleanup and organization of outdated content
- Always reference actual file paths when suggesting connections

## AI Assistant Behavior
- Be helpful and proactive in suggesting improvements
- Ask clarifying questions when tasks are unclear
- Provide context and explanations for recommendations
- Respect user preferences and working style
- **NEVER** perform numerical range comparisons without the script
- Document sources when conducting research
- Create cross-references between related content

## Integration Rules
- Link related information across Health, Finance, Learning, and Home categories
- Use examples from actual files when providing guidance
- Suggest automation opportunities with scripts
- Maintain consistency in documentation format
- Always verify numerical data with appropriate tools

## Information Architecture & Anti-Hallucination Rules

### Core Principle
Eliminate ambiguities, unnecessary duplicates, inconsistencies, and unclear sources while maintaining high accuracy.

### 1. Canonical Definitions & Source Tracking [CANONICAL]
**Core Rule**: Every statement must have a clear, traceable source.

**Canonical Source System**:
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each concept/definition has ONE canonical version in the most logical source document
- **Mark Canonical**: Tag with `[CANONICAL]` in the source document where information is first established
- **Reference Everywhere Else**: All other mentions must use `[REF: folder/filename.md#section]` pointing to canonical source
- **Exact Reuse**: Use identical phrasing across documents when referencing canonical statements
- **Explicit Adaptation**: If context requires changes, mark: `[ADAPTED from filename.md: "original" → "adapted"]`

**Source Tracking Requirements**:
- **No Orphan Statements**: Every claim, metric, or assertion must be traceable to its origin
- **Clear Attribution**: Mark where information came from: personal records, external research, calculations, etc.
- **Update Propagation**: When changing canonical version, search and update all `[REF:]` references
- **Searchable References**: Use consistent `[REF:]` format to enable finding all dependencies

### 2. Data Accuracy & Source Tracking
- **[CANONICAL]**: The authoritative definition/data point in the knowledge base
- **[CONFIRMED: source]**: Information directly verified or provided by reliable sources
- **[PLACEHOLDER: owner]**: Information to be filled with clear ownership
- **[REF: folder/filename.md#section]**: Cross-references for searchability

### 3. Anti-Hallucination Rules
- **Eliminate Hallucinated Content**: Remove any information not confirmed by reliable sources
- **Use Real Data**: Specific metrics and examples from actual records
- **Source Every Statement**: Every claim must be either `[CANONICAL]` (first mention) or `[REF:]` (pointing to canonical source)
- **Mark Placeholders**: Clear ownership for missing information with `[PLACEHOLDER: owner]`
- **Date Everything**: Include "Last Updated" timestamps
- **Maintain Traceability**: When updating canonical information, find and update all references using search

 Information Architecture & Anti-Hallucination Rules

## Positioning Rules

### Market Focus [CANONICAL]
- **Primary Target**: [TARGET_MARKET] businesses spending >[THRESHOLD]/month on [PRIMARY_EXPENSE]
- **Sweet Spot**: $[MIN]-[MAX]/month [SPEND_CATEGORY] companies seeking [VALUE_PROPOSITION] vs [ALTERNATIVE_PRICING_MODEL]
- **Market Gap**: [TARGET_MARKET] businesses underserved by [COMPETITOR_FOCUS]-focused [CATEGORY] platforms
- **Geographic Scope**: Primary focus [REGION_1] ([X]% of revenue), secondary markets in [REGION_2], select clients globally
- **Core Differentiation**: [EXPERTISE_1] + [INNOVATION] ("[ANALOGY]") vs competitors' [LIMITATION] solutions
- **Technology Position**: [INTERFACE_TYPE] for [USE_CASE] vs [COMPETITOR_APPROACH]

### Competitive Messaging [REF: Competitors/competitive-landscape-summary.md#competitive-messaging]

#### [PRODUCT_V1] Competition ([CATEGORY_1]) [REF: Competitors/competitive-landscape-summary.md#product-v1-competition]
- **vs [CATEGORY_1] Platforms** ([COMPETITOR_A], [COMPETITOR_B]): [SPECIALIZATION] + [ADVANTAGE_1] + [ADVANTAGE_2]
- **vs [CATEGORY_2] Tools** ([COMPETITOR_C], [COMPETITOR_D]): [FEATURE_1] + [FEATURE_2] + [INTEGRATION_DEPTH]
- **vs [CATEGORY_3] Platforms**: [FOCUS_AREA] vs [COMPETITOR_FOCUS]

#### [PRODUCT_V2] Competition ([CATEGORY_2]) [REF: Competitors/competitive-landscape-summary.md#product-v2-competition]
- **vs [AUTOMATION_TYPE] Platforms** ([COMPETITOR_E], [COMPETITOR_F]): "[VISION_PHRASE]" [INTERFACE] across [X] core use cases vs [COMPETITOR_LIMITATION], [SCOPE] vs [COMPETITOR_SCOPE], [DATA_ADVANTAGE] vs [COMPETITOR_DATA_LIMITATION]
- **Key Differentiators**: [FOUNDATION], [COVERAGE], "[ANALOGY]" [INTERFACE] vs [COMPETITOR_INTERFACE]
- **Competitive Advantage**: Only [COMPREHENSIVE_SOLUTION] built on [EXPERTISE] and [DATA_DEPTH]

#### Combined Positioning [REF: Competitors/competitive-landscape-summary.md#combined-positioning]
- **Unique Advantage**: Only platform combining [EXPERTISE] with [COMPREHENSIVE_SOLUTION] across [X] core use cases
- **Data Foundation**: [AUTOMATION] built on [DATA_TYPE], not just [COMPETITOR_DATA_TYPE]
- **Market Gap**: [TARGET_MARKET] underserved by [COMPETITOR_FOCUS_1] and [FRAGMENTATION_ISSUE]
- **Vision Advantage**: "[VISION_PHRASE]" - transform [INDUSTRY] from [CURRENT_STATE] to [FUTURE_STATE]

## Competitor Analysis Process [CANONICAL]

**Deep Research Required**: When user requests competitor analysis, conduct comprehensive research across multiple sources. Key areas to research: product pages, pricing pages, founder backgrounds, press releases, funding announcements, G2/Capterra reviews, case studies, use cases, performance claims, customer testimonials, and strategic partnerships. Use web search for funding rounds, founder LinkedIn profiles, industry coverage, and competitor comparisons.

**Process**:
1. **Research**: Conduct comprehensive research per requirements above
2. **Create**: `[company-name]-analysis.md` using 11-section template (Company Overview → Bottom Line)
3. **Classify**: [CATEGORY_1] ([EXAMPLE_A]) | [CATEGORY_2] ([EXAMPLE_B]) | [CATEGORY_3] ([EXAMPLE_C])
4. **Update Summary**: Update `competitive-landscape-summary.md` with cross-references

## Common Use Cases

- **Pitch Deck Creation**: Pull from Company-Overview, Product/, Business-Model, Team, and Competitors Analysis
- **Investor Due Diligence**: Focus on Market-Analysis, Business-Model, Financials, and Competitors
- **Team Onboarding**: Use Company-Overview, Product, Team, and Competitors
- **Strategic Planning**: Reference Market-Analysis, Business-Model, Investor-Updates, and Competitors
- **Fundraising Materials**: Combine executive-summary.md with competitive analysis
- **Competitive Analysis**: Deep dive into Competitors/ for threat assessment and positioning
- **New Competitor Research**: Follow comprehensive analysis process and update competitive summary
