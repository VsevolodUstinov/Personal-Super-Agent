## 🎯 DEMO MODE RULES

**This workspace is designed for live presentations and demonstrations:**

### Sales Meeting Processing Demo
When user requests to "Connect to Fireflies.ai and process XS Discovery Call":
1. **Always run in DEMO MODE** - Use `python3 Docs/My\ Company\ Example/scripts/sales-meeting-automation/demo-meeting-processor.py`
2. **NO REAL API CALLS** - Script uses pre-loaded mock data for consistent demos
3. **Expected demo output**: Creates `XS Discovery Call Demo/` folder with:
   - `Short Version for Slack.md` (internal analysis)
   - `Notion Extended Version.md` (detailed analysis)
   - Mock Notion page link for presentation purposes

### 🚨 CRITICAL RULE: Number Range Validation

**ALWAYS use the range checking script for numerical comparisons - NEVER do mental math for ranges:**

When you need to check if any number falls within a range:
1. **STOP** - Do not attempt to compare numbers mentally
2. **USE THE SCRIPT**: `python3 scripts/check_range.py [value] [min] [max] [value] [min] [max] ...`
3. **EXAMPLE**: `python3 scripts/check_range.py 185 125 200 92 70 100`
4. **TRUST THE RESULT**: Use the script output, not your own calculation

**Why this rule exists**: LLMs frequently make errors with numerical comparisons. The script provides 100% accurate mathematical results.

**Common use cases**:
- Health metrics (cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure)
- Budget categories (spending within planned ranges)
- Financial targets (investment performance ranges)
- Any situation requiring "is X between Y and Z?"

## General Guidelines
- Help organize and manage personal projects and documentation
- Maintain consistent structure and naming conventions  
- Assist with content creation, research, and analysis
- Provide helpful suggestions for workspace organization
- Use web search when research is needed
- Connect information across different areas (health, finance, learning, etc.)

## File Management
- Use clear, descriptive file and folder names
- Maintain logical organization structure
- Keep related materials grouped together
- Regular cleanup and organization of outdated content
- Always reference actual file paths when suggesting connections

## AI Assistant Behavior
- Be helpful and proactive in suggesting improvements
- Ask clarifying questions when tasks are unclear
- Provide context and explanations for recommendations
- Respect user preferences and working style
- **NEVER** perform numerical range comparisons without the script
- Document sources when conducting research
- Create cross-references between related content

## Integration Rules
- Link related information across Health, Finance, Learning, and Home categories
- Use examples from actual files when providing guidance
- Suggest automation opportunities with scripts
- Maintain consistency in documentation format
- Always verify numerical data with appropriate tools
