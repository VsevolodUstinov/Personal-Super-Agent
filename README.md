## 🤔 Why not just use ChatGPT?

### ChatGPT: Just a chat

* ❌ Long threads that get lost
* ❌ Can’t work with your files directly
* ❌ Doesn’t write and run code in your workspace
* ❌ Forgets context across sessions
* ❌ Only text answers

### Personal Super Agent (in Cursor): Your digital operator

* ✅ **Works with real files** — creates, edits, organizes
* ✅ **Writes and runs code** — solves tasks with automation
* ✅ **Remembers** — your knowledge is structured in files
* ✅ **Searches the web** — brings fresh answers with sources
* ✅ **Connects everything** — health, finance, learning, home

## 🎯 What can you do with it?

### 🏥 Health management

```bash
# Find medical ranges online and verify with a precise script
python3 scripts/check_range.py 185 125 200
# ✅ In range — the medical note gets updated
```

### 💰 Financial planning

* Analyze expenses by category
* Check if you’re within budget ranges
* Generate monthly reports and saving plans

### 📚 Smart learning

* Research books/courses and summarize
* Create structured notes with action items
* Connect insights to your goals

### 🏠 Home projects

* Track renovation progress
* Plan purchases and budgets
* Automate repetitive tasks

### 📊 Blood test check

The AI finds medical ranges online and verifies your numbers with the script:

```

   185.0 | [ 125.0 -  200.0] | ✅ In range
    92.0 | [  70.0 -  100.0] | ✅ In range
==================================================
```

### 📚 Book research

```
You: “Find Ray Dalio’s book about empires and cycles”
AI: Found “Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order”
    → Created detailed notes
    → Added to reading list

## 🔍 Open-Source Superpower: Don’t build from scratch

Why code for weeks if someone already did it? Your Super Agent can locate and adapt existing open-source projects under your goals.

### 🏆 Real cases

#### 📧 Gmail

```bash
# Ask the AI to find and adapt
“Find open-source projects for Gmail automation”
→ gmail-fisher: extract finance data from emails
→ gas-openai-gmail-labeller: classify emails with LLMs
```

#### 💰 Finance

```bash
→ Parsers for Uber Eats/Bolt Food receipts
→ Automatic JSON expense reports
→ Reconciliation with bank statements
```

#### 🏥 Medical

```bash
→ PDF parsers for lab results
→ Health metrics trackers
→ Fitness device integrations
```

### ⚡ Typical flow


1. Describe your task
2. The AI researches GitHub
3. Picks candidates and explains trade-offs
4. Adapts the project into your workspace
5. Integrates with your data and structure

### ⏱️ Time saved (examples)

* Email automation: months → hours
* Expense tracking: weeks → a day
* Health data: weeks → hours


---

## 🛠️ Exact numeric checks (critical!)

LLMs often make mistakes with number ranges. This template includes a precise checker:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_range.py 185 125 200 92 70 100
# value min max [triplets]
```

Use it for health metrics, budgets, targets — anytime you need “is X between Y and Z?”.
