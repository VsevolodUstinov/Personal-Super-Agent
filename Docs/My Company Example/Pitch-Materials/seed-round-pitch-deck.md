## üéØ Slide 1: The Problem

### Performance Marketers Are Drowning in Complexity

**Spending 2+ hours daily in reports, manually analyzing trends and making optimization decisions**

#### Current Pain Points:
- **Multiple disconnected platforms** - Google Ads, Facebook, analytics, CRM all separate
- **Attribution lies** - Facebook/Google claim credit for same conversions
- **Manual optimization** - Pause/scale campaigns one by one, check ROAS manually
- **Complex interfaces** - Learn different software for each platform
- **No full-funnel data** - Ad algorithms optimize for leads, not paying customers

#### Result: 
**Marketing directors waste 90% of their time on manual tasks instead of strategy**
